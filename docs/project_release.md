### Regression testing

2. Provide the link to regression testing script and provide last snapshot of the execution and results of regression testing. 


### Load testing

1. Describe the environment for load testing, such as tool, load test cases.  
2. Provide the test report for load testing. 
3. Discuss one bottleneck found in the load testing. 
   
For instance, if you use Jmeter, please upload the jmx file on GitHub and provide link. Also a snapshot of the results, discuss whether the load testing is passed or not.  

### Security Analysis

1. Describe the choice of the security analysis tool and how do you run it. The security analysis tool should analyze the language that is used in the majority of your source code. 
2. Attach a report as an appendix below from static analysis tools by running the security analysis tool on your source code. Randomly select 5 detected problems and discuss what you see. Note that you are not required to fix the alarms (bugs and vulnerabilities) in the course.
