## Vision

FamilyHub is a web-based application designed to help families stay on top of important events with their loved ones through the use of a shared calendar. This application aims to reduce friction and conflict within families by enabling them to improve their organization and communication of events. Thus, FamilyHub will help bring families closer together by giving them an avenue to stay connected, share memories, plan events, and build stronger bonds.

## Summary

FamilyHub is designed primarily for the use of families who are wanting to organize and keep track of their shared events, such as birthdays, anniversaries, movie nights, etc. It allows family members to gain access to a privately shared calendar where they can add, edit, and remove one-time or recurring events. This shared calendar can only be viewed by members of that family group. Additionally, to improve communication, FamilyHub will feature a shared message board, where family members will be able to share photos and messages that are viewable by the entire family. 

This application is valuable because it can help reduce the stress of planning and remembering family events. Being able to view all family events on one calendar helps to avoid scheduling conflicts when planning new events. Additionally, as the events are shared with everyone in the family group, the issue of having to invite each family member every time is avoided. Thus, family members can have confidence in knowing that no one is accidentally left out. The shared message board will also bring value to families by providing them with a centralized place to share photos and messages with each other. Overall, the goal of FamilyHub is to bring families closer together and to create a positive impact on the relationships and connections among family members. 

After some use, users of the application will be asked to complete a survey that compares the FamilyHub application to traditional wall calendars. The success of this application will be determined by the following criteria. First, a majority of users should prefer to use this application over traditional wall calendars. Second, the average frequency of application usage should be at least twice a week.
